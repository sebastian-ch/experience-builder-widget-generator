# Widget Creator for ArcGIS Experience Builder

    This node module generates a custom experience builder widget from your command line. You can choose any of the demos in [the official ArcGIS Experience Builder page](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-experience-builder-sdk-resources/tree/master/widgets) as a template.
## Installation

Install the package globally:

```bash
npm install -g esri-widget-generator
```


go to your experience builder folder ``ArcGISExperienceBuilder\client\your-extensions\widgets``
(it will install the folder anywhere though)


run ``create-widget``
give your widget a name and select the template

![]("example.gif")




that should be it!
